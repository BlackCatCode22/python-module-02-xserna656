1) Watch the video and code up the Payroll Program with Overtime (Worked Exercise 3.1)  Name your script: work_ex_3_1.py

2) Watch the video and add exception handling to your payroll program (Worked Exercise 3.2) Name your script: work_ex_3_2.py

3) Watch the video and code up a program that uses a function named comput_pay (Worked Exercise 4.6) Name your script: work_ex_4_6.py

4) Write a Python program that uses nested if statements (nested decisions) to get three integers from the user and outputs the largest of the three. Name your script: largest_of_3.py

5) Code up a PythonProgram that uses a function to create a detailed output message to the user after finding the largest of three numbers. The detailed output statement should look something like this:

Message to User: You entered three numbers, 32, 57, and 99. The first whole number you entered was assigned to a variable named num1, 
the second to (57) to num2, and finally the third (99) was assigned to num3. 
Your inout was processed and the largest number you entered was 99, which belonged to an integer variable named num3.

This is a little advanced and will required more coding to keep track of the variablke name that contained the largest of three.

Name your script: detailed_output.py

Help your classmates out by asking and answering questions in the Student Coffee Shop discussion.

Do not use ChatGPT to write your Python code, figure this out and code it up using your human brain!

Remember to commit your GitHub Classroom repo pushes whenever you add a Python script to your repo. Creating more scripts than the required ones named aboved is always encouraged and add these to your remote GitHub Classroom repo to show me what you're working on.
